BY MY 30th Birthday

1. Learn Coding
	Desc - I would like to be back on pace with my OSSU coding school. November is going to provide a perfect opportunity to learn, with all of these weekdays to work.
	Concrete - I don't know yet. I would prefer an achievable goal like a thing to accomplish, like a complex program written in Haskell
	Plan - 2 hour a day T-F to start. Plus at least one unit per shift at work. Revisit plan in December. Possibly going to Library after work M-W

2. Speak Mandarin
	Desc - We are looking to go back to China. I desperately want to continue learning. I need to pick Anki back up, finish HelloChinese, watch more TV (especially after I finish the Americans), and get some Pods for the car, perhaps downloading on phone. Maybe look into sentence mining.
	Concrete - A good concrete target would be HSK2. That would be difficult by my birthday but would be doable for sure by May. Maybe, I can read one of the kids' books, sing the Internationale and know every character, and maybe know all the dialog for either Journey to the West or an episode of Wu Xin or something.
	Plan - Anki with Breakfast. Finish Hello Chinese. 100% TV and Car sounds Mandarin. Revisit YoYo if this becomes easy. Also, look into tranlating things like the Internationale etc

3. Be In Shape
	Desc - If D-Rose can do it, so can I! I've spent the majority of my 20s mostly out of shape. I have about a decade of good athleticism left, so I owe it to myself and to my love of basketball to be able to compete at some level. I have to quit drinking, lose weight, and exercise consistently
	Concrete - I think Dunking is the perfect goal. I want to dunk on my birthday.
	Plan -  No drinking, Counting calories (eat bran flakes and fish and beans), Exercise daily and ball. Exercise swiftly in morning after wake up. Don't eat on overnights after 3. Crappy workout at work after checkup. Excercise before bed. T-F workout at YMCA.
